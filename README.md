## High-order functions in JavaScript

Inspired by the [@MPJME](https://twitter.com/mpjme)'s YouTube [Functional Programing](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0zVEGEvSaeEd9hlmCXrk5yUyqUag-n84) series.

## Why?

**You learn by doing.**
Instead of just watching him, I decided to code along and get a feel for what he's trying to teach.

This also serves me as quick reference whenever I need a quick refresher on high-order functions.

## Running This

```
git clone
npm install
npm run transpile-es2015
```

To run this in your command line:

```
cd .\lib\
node .\GENERATED_FILE.js
```

Example:
```
node .\example-map.js
```
